1. A recent national study showed that approximately 44.7% of college students have used Wikipedia as a
source in at least one of their term papers. Let X equal the number of students in a random sample of
size n = 31 who have used Wikipedia as a source.
Perform the below functions

a. Find the probability that X is equal to 17


dbinom(17,31,0.447)


b. Find the probability that X is at most 13


dbinom(13,31,0.447)


c. Find the probability that X is bigger than 11.

dbinom(11,31.0.447)



d. Find the probability that X is at least 15.

dbinom(15,31.0.447)



e. Find the probability that X is between 16 and 19 inclusive

dbinom(19-16,31,0.447)
